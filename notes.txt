Notes should be treated as a continuous stream of data that 
can be subscribed to. They have the added benefit of keeping
track of whether or not a given subscriber has seen them
yet. This effectively means that naasgul manages individual
message queues for each of its subscribers.

Subscribers should be able to ask for their unread notes, and some defined number
of historical notes that have been read. By default, notes should be considered 
fairly volatile and can not be guaranteed to live beyond 30 days.

Subscribers to naasgul, with the correct permissions, should be allowed to push
notes to any number of other subscribers (provided they can identify them all).

Notes should be flexible enough in format to allow for as many use cases as possible
in the space of real time messaging.

A Note should have a sender, a sent date (created date?), payload of some sort.

There should be some kind of allowance for groupings of subscribers and, potentially,
groupings of groups.
